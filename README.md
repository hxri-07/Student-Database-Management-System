# Student-Database-Management-System
This is a Student Database Management System I have created way back in grade 12. This was the final project of my high school. Sure was fun, applied quite a bit of the concepts I had learnt. We connect MySQL to Python and keep interacting back and forth between the two. All the data is stored on MySQL and is handled via Python.
